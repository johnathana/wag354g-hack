This directory contains the decompression algorithms for lzma. There are
actually two different sets of files here, all kinda mashed together. The
decompressor for the kernel is contained in LzmaDecode.* LzmaWrapper.*. These
use a C version of decompressing that only uses a small amount of memory. The
other set is from the 7zip program, stripped out from the rest of that code.

There is a correlation between the magic values for the decoder and encoder.

TODO: List these out.
